				<p class="subpageParagraphs"> Throughout my high school and college careers, I have learned many valuable skills along the way. Even though I have picked up numerous software skills as a programmer, computer science has taught me more about problem solving and innovative thinking than anything else. Listed below are my skills, both techincal and non-techincal, as well as my familiarity with each of them. </p>

				<h2 class="subpageParagraphs">Programming Skills</h2>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs"> Listed below are all of my programming skills and my familiarity with each language/software</p>

				<h3 class="subpageParagraphs">Java</h3>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					Java is the first programming language I learned. Starting in high school, I was assigned the role as the programmer of my robotics team. During this experience, I learned the very basics about Java syntax and expressions, learning how a program runs. With this knowledge, I was able to program our team's robot to accomplish certain tasks in our robot competition. However, I didn't truly develop a proper understanding of the language until I got to college. After enjoying robotics and programming, I decided that computer science would be a good fit for me. Coming to Purdue, the first computer science course I took was learning Java. In this course, I developed a solid understanding of the language as well as key object-oriented programming principles in inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. I also have a solid understanding of exception handling, multithreaded programs, synchronization, file i/o, network communication, dynamic data structures, and recursion. Outside of my coursework, I have created two projects with java. The first one was the program I developed for our robotics team's competition. The other one is an android app I created after the java course to learn about android development. This application is an organizational vacation planning app, which people can use to organize travel plans. More details of this can be found in the projects tab. Along with what I've learned through robotics and college, I'm also learning more about java frameworks and API building in my current internship with John Deere. These skills include learning about the Spring Framework and using Maven Projects to resolve dependencies. Overall, I definitely have the most programming experience with Java and feel very comfortable with the language.

				<h3 class="subpageParagraphs"> C/ C++</h3>

					After taking a java course in my first semester of college, I took a course on C and C++ in my second semester.
