# my-website
This repository is for my personal website, which I have created for employers and others to see, and in effort to learn more about web design. I mainly used html to design this website, and css to add styling features. To put my website on the web, I bought my domain from www.godaddy.com and used aws to host it. In hosting it, I used one S3 bucket containing all my files and a Route53 hosted zone to connect the nameserver to my domain. The link to my website is www.aditya-subramaniam.com
