					With my passion for computer science, I spend my free time in summers and winters working on coding projects of my choice. On this page are the different projects I have worked on with descriptions of what they are.

					In my first programming course at Purdue, I learned Java and the fundamentals of object-oriented programming. After taking the course, I wanted to learn about android development, because I was interested in learning how to create apps. Due to the fact that I had knowledge in java after taking the course, I felt that creating an android application would be the best choice for my first side project. When brainstorming ideas for what the application should be, I thought about what application would be useful for someone like me. As I love to travel a lot, I realized that most of the time, I tend to be disorganized when planning a trip somewhere. Suddenly, the thought came to me that I could create an app to organize my travel plans when I go on vacations. As I built this application, I learned many of the features of Android Studio as well as how to connect the xml-designed front end UI with the backend of Java. Some of the features of my app include, a homepage with a menu to create a vacation or view current vacations (first picture above), a form to create a vacation (second picture above), a homepage for all the vacations created, homepage for a specific vacation (third picture above), form to create a leisure event (fourth picture above), and a form to create a commute/transportation event. Overall, I really enjoyed this project because I got to use the fundamentals I learned in java, learned about the differences between backend and frontend programming, and how to connect teh two together.

				<h2 class="subpageParagraphs">Personal Website</h2>

					Believe it or not, I actually started this website as a project. As I finished up my freshman year at Purdue, I was super eager to learn more languages over the summer. I was still learning Python as a continuation of what I learned in the winter, but I also wanted to start picking up important frontend languages as well. In an effort to do this, I wanted to start with HTML and CSS. During the previous semester at Purdue, I learned how to program in LaTex, so I could type up my homework assignments neatly. Because of this, I was able to pick up HTML and CSS quite easily. I also had plans to create a nice professional website about myself, so I decided, why not use the skills I've learned in HTML and CSS. Overall, creating this website has really helped me develop a solid understanding of tags and elements in HTML as well as the different styles in CSS.
