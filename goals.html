				<h1 style="text-align: center;">Future Goals</h1>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					As a computer scientist, I have many different goals and aspirations for my future. First and foremost, my biggest goal begins with why I chose to pursue a computer science career in the first place. I wanted to pick a career path which would allow me to make a difference in the world. After learning about how research in artificial intelligence has exploded in an attempt to do just that, I knew that computer science would be a great career choice for me.  
				</p>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					As I continue through college and my career, I want to continue the work of others and make even more groundbreaking discoveries in machine learning and artificial intelligence. As I take part in daily activities, I always think about how differently the world would function if artificial intelligence took over the world. For example, imagine a world in which there were safe self-driving autonomous cars, automated security systems, robotic shopping carts, and many more innovative creations. The possibilities are endless, and the work starts now. This not only means creating new technologies, but also ensuring their reliability and safety. Even though technology and automation has been booming in the last decade, many are still quite hesitant about it. There are still many fears about the safety of these new techonolgies that make use of machine learning and AI concepts. Lets face it, the thought of sitting in a car and letting it drive on its own would seem extremely dangerous to anyone.
				</p>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					As a computer scientist, my goal in advancing research in machine learning and artificial intelligence is to discover new ways of ensuring safety and designing sustainable and safe technologies that people can depend upon to make their lives more comfortable and hassle-free. Wouldn't it be nice to trust that technology won't malfunction at the wrong time? My hope is that in the near future, people can get inside a self-driving car and trust that it will drive them safely to wherever they want to go. Along with self-driving cars, every form of technology should be reliable as well, and I'm ready to help make that happen!
				</p>

				<br>


				<h2 class="subpageParagraphs">How will I pursue these goals?</h2>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					With the goals I have to help make new discoveries in machine learning and AI, I plan to accomplish numerous tasks to work towards these goals. As I pursue my bachelor's degree at Purdue, I plan to get a solid foundation in machine intelligence in the process. At Purdue, the computer science department allows students to focus on specific computer science tracks after taking foundational CS courses for the first two years. These tracks include different subdisciplines like software engineering, machine intelligence, cyber-security, systems programming, graphics, databases, and many more. In pursuing my goals, I plan to focus on the software engineering and machine intelligence tracks to learn more about these disciplines. Along with my computer science degree, I also plan to earn minors in management and math. I have chosen to pursue a management minor in order to improve my soft skills as well as understand how business works. At the end of my college career, I hope that having a business background will complement my techincal skills well in the workforce. I plan to pursue a math minor mainly because of how much I've enjoyed math since high school. In pursuing a math minor, I hope to develop a solid understanding of theoretical computer science and learn more about how statistics relate to machine learning.
				</p>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					After I complete my bachelor's degree in computer science, I plan to pursue graduate school, research, and a full time job in machine learning or AI. In pursuing graduate school and partaking in research, I hope to learn more about machine intelligence and develop a strong foundation of computer science as I get into the job force. In my career, I hope to work for a company that plans to make big leaps and bounds in the AI world with new technologies for this day and age. 
				</p>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					Outside of college, I plan to take part in other things to pursue my goals. Currently, I am working at John Deere as a software engineering intern for building APIs for the company and developing backend software for the company's applications. I also work on side projects in the summer and winter to learn more about software development and create new things. I am also active on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/subram43" target="_blank" style="padding-right: 0%; color: blue;">kaggle</a>, learning more about data science and machine learning. If you would like to contact me or have any questions about my projects, goals, or anything in general, you can contact me by email or phone below under the "Contact Me" section.
