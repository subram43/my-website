				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					I was born in 1999 in Ann Arbor, Michigan. As a young child, I had a passion for building things. Whether it was a popsickle stick bridge or a pinewood derby car, I was ready to build anything. I first developed this passion when I joined my elementary school's cub scouts troop at three years old. In cub scouts, we had numerous racing competitions, which included the pinewood derby, space derby, and boat derby competitions. In the pinewood derby competition, we got a block of wood, four standard wheels, and four nails, and he had to design and create a fast car to compete in a race against everyone else's cars. The space derby and boat derby were the same idea, but required the design of a rocket and boat instead. In my first pinewood derby competition, I barely missed the top three by half a second. After walking out of the competition without a trophy that day, I was really disappointed and upset with myself for it. However, this experience motivated me to come back bigger next time. The following year, I got second. The following three years, I won first place three times in a row. This experience allowed me to get my feet wet in engineering, and I continued to participate in competitions like these in my childhood. 
				</p>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					Along with building things, I also took interest in sports from a young age. When I was four, I started playing baseball and soccer. After a year, I found out that I was really enjoying baseball and started to focus on it. Baseball not only became a great hobby that I really enjoyed, but it also became a fantastic way for me to meet new friends and make connections. My friends got me so hooked onto baseball that I even started following the Detroit Tigers, the MLB team from Detroit. 
				</p>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					In 2008, we moved to Bettendorf, Iowa as a family. At first, I was really scared about transitioning from a big city life to a small, midwestern town. I missed lots of things about Detroit, but I also found many new opportunities in Iowa. I still continued to follow the Tigers and play baseball, and I still took part in Cub Scouts and Pinewood Derby competitions. When I turned eight years old, I decided I also wanted to try tennis. After trying it out, I really began to love the sport and followed it on a regular basis as well. I began to idolize Roger Federer and made an active effort to play whenever I could. By the time I got to high school, I ended up getting so serious about tennis that I dropped baseball for it. The effort definitely paid off in the end as I earned three varsity letters in high school for tennis. During my senior year, I even made it to state, and our team got fourth place in the team state competition. Even though my competitive career ended after high school, I still love playing tennis in my free time.
				</p>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					Even as I had a passion for sports, my interest in engineering and design grew. I continued to participate in Pinewood Derby competitions, and I took a few engineering courses in middle school. I also joined my school's robotics team in sixth grade. After participating in robotics and taking these engineering courses, I was certain that my career interest would be in a STEM field. Which STEM field it would be was still uncertain, but having done robotics and learning how to solve problems as a team really sparked my interest. The next biggest factor which caught my interest in STEM was math. Throughout elementary and middle school, I liked math, but I never really took excitement in learning it really well. However, when I got to ninth grade, I took a geometry course with arguably one of the best teachers I've had in my life. Even though this class might have been one of the most challenging that I've taken, it really pushed me to expand my problem solving skills and think in ways I've never thought before. This class on its own sparked my interest in a math based career, and it pushed me to take interest and enjoy learning math for the rest of high school.
				</p>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					As I continued participating in robotics throughout high school, I got to my junior year and still hadn't figured out which STEM field I wanted to get into. That year, I decided I wanted to try out as the programmer on the school team. Initially, I found programming really difficult and didn't know how to start, but eventually I got a hang of it and really started to enjoy it as well. Along with that, my father one day gave me two articles to read about machine learning and artificial intelligence. After reading these articles and seeing how much the computer science field has been exploding, I started to follow the news on it more and more. Slowly, I started to develop interest and decided that with my passion for STEM and math, computer science would be something that I would enjoy.
				</p>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					As I decided that I would pursue a career in computer science, my next step was picking a college where I would pursue that dream. After looking at some schools and doing research, I took a visit to Purdue. After my tour there, I knew right away that Purdue was where my next home would be. The beatiful campus, student culture, friendly and gentle faculty, and the diverse student body all made me realize that Purdue was where I was meant to be. Coming into the first semester, however, I was really nervous about how I would perform there. I came into Purdue with much less programming experience than most of the students in CS. Because of the learning curve, the first few weeks of the first course were a real challenge for me. I was often the last one out of labs and struggled to finish the homework assignments which everyone else found easy. I got really discouraged by this and began to wonder whether computer science was really meant for me. Due to my struggles, I reached out to my TA to ask if he had any advice on how I should work through the course and how to develop better study habits. My TA was really happy to help me and assured me that I would eventually get the hang of it. Thankfully, I stuck with it and worked really hard to understand java as well as I could. By the end of the semester, I ended up loving programming so much that I couldn't wait to go home so I could learn more programming languages. 
				</p>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					After how much I learned in my first year at Purdue, I started to develop a strong passion for computer science. Along with playing tennis and watching sports in my free time, I started to learn more languages and work on programming projects on my own as well. Currently, I am working as a backend software engineering intern at John Deere in Moline, Illinois. In my job, I work on building APIs and testing software with the agile software development lifecycle. Heading into my sophomore year this fall, I look forward to see what my future holds.

				<!-- <p class="subpageParagraphs"> Throughout my high school and college careers, I have learned many valuable skills along the way. Even though I have picked up numerous software skills as a programmer, computer science has taught me more about problem solving and innovative thinking than anything else. Listed below are my skills, both techincal and non-techincal, as well as my familiarity with each of them. </p>

				<h2 class="subpageParagraphs">Programming Skills</h2>

				<p class="subpageParagraphs"> Listed below are all of my programming skills and my familiarity with each language/software</p>

				<h3 class="subpageParagraphs">Java</h3>

				<img class="photo" src="pictures/java.png"> 

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					Java is the first programming language I learned. Starting in high school, I was assigned the role as the programmer of my robotics team. During this experience, I learned the very basics about Java syntax and expressions, learning how a program runs. With this knowledge, I was able to program our team's robot to accomplish certain tasks in our robot competition. However, I didn't truly develop a proper understanding of the language until I got to college. After enjoying robotics and programming, I decided that computer science would be a good fit for me. Coming to Purdue, the first computer science course I took was learning Java. In this course, I developed a solid understanding of the language as well as key object-oriented programming principles in inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation. I also have a solid understanding of exception handling, multithreaded programs, synchronization, file i/o, network communication, dynamic data structures, and recursion. Outside of my coursework, I have created two projects with java. The first one was the program I developed for our robotics team's competition. The other one is an android app I created after the java course to learn about android development. This application is an organizational vacation planning app, which people can use to organize travel plans. More details of this can be found in the projects tab. Along with what I've learned through robotics and college, I'm also learning more about java frameworks and API building in my current internship with John Deere. These skills include learning about the Spring Framework and using Maven Projects to resolve dependencies. Overall, I definitely have the most programming experience with Java and feel very comfortable with the language.

				<h3 class="subpageParagraphs"> C/ C++</h3>

				<img class="photo" src="pictures/c.png" style="margin-right: 4%; margin-left: 2%;">

				<p class="subpageParagraphs">
					After taking a java course in my first semester of college, I took a course on C and C++ in my second semester. After taking the java course, I had a much better understanding of how programming works and variable types, which I didn't have before the course. Because of this, it was much easier for me to understand the concepts in C/C++, even though there are many differences between C/ C++ and java. In the course I took, we first learned how to program in C. In C, I developed a solid understanding of data types, arrays, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, bit manipulation, stacks, and linked lists (both singly and doubly). In C++, I have a solid understanding of classes, header and implementation files, methods, contructors, instance variables, inheritance, and abstraction.
